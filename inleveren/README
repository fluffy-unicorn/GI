The implementation is tested with Python 3.5.2 and Python 3.6.1.
While it should work with each version of Python 3, the latter is recommended.

The program can handle .gr and .grl files.
With .gr files, it is assumed that the counting automorphism problem must be solved.
With .grl files, a switch is added to tell the program to either show the (pairwise)
isomorphisms or the number of automorphisms of each graph in the file.

The program has to be called as follows:
(For .gr files):
python3 main.py filename.gr
(For .grl files, isomorphism problem):
python3 main.py filename.grl -i
(For .grl files, # automorphisms problem):
python3 main.py filename.grl -a
